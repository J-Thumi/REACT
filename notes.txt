components describe a part of the user interface
they can be nested and are reusable
are buildind blocks of every react app
there are several components i.e header, main content, side nav, footer and component having other components
components can be stateful class components or stateless functional components
stateful class components have render methods


FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS
functional components are just js functions that accepts properties and returns html

create a component with js extension 
in it:

import React from 'react'

define  a function mostly use arow functions
export it : export default function-name
then import in the app.js : import function-name from full-path
the full path example : './component/greet'
the above means component is a folder in the same folder as the app.js and greet is a file in the component folder
in the return part of the app call the imported function as a html tag or a self closing tag i.e <Greet></Greet> or <Greet/>

export const Greet=()=> <h1>Hello user</h1>
if you export like this import as shown below
import {Greet}  from './components/greet'

if you export: export default Greet 
you can use any name in the import
import mycomp from path
but in the return use same name in import


CLASS COMPONENTS
typically ES6 classes
in the component import 2 things
import React  , {Component} from 'react'
define a class that extends from Components:
class welcome extends Component{
    render(){
        return <h1></h1>
    }
}
export default welcome 
then import in the app.js : import function-name from full-path
the full path example : './component/welcome'
the above means component is a folder in the same folder as the app.js and greet is a file in the component folder
in the return part of the app call the imported function as a html tag or a self closing tag i.e <welcome></welcome> or <welcome/>


functional are used mostly
lack this keyword
mainly responsible for UI
provide lifecycle hooks

class Components 
maintain their own private data-statefulcomplex UI logic
provide lifecycle hooks


not regular html is returned but jsx
JSX
JAVASCRIPT XML makes react code simpler and elegant
if the jsx is taking multiple lines use ()
example:
return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>REACT</h1>
< Greet namee='jose' hero='captain America'/>
 </div>);
 there must be only one wrapper tag in jsx i.e div in above 

 if its a single line no need

you can return regular html instead of jsx
in the return of the function in the component



return React.createElement('div',{id:'hello'},React.createElement('h1',{id:'not jsx'},'this is not jsx'))
example:
import React from 'react'

const Name=()=>{
    return React.createElement('div',{id:'hello'},React.createElement('h1',{id:'notjsx'},'this is not jsx'))
}

export default Name

PROPS 
it is short for properties

components are reusable this means we can call the imported function in the return of app.js a many times a we want
this returns the same output several times we can change the output 
give each call of the imported an attribute of what you want to change example
< Greet namee='jose'/>
< Greet namee='jane'/>
< Greet namee='john'/>
in the Greet function have a props parameter
and where you want the changes to appear write {props.namee}
example:
const Greet=(props)=>{

 return <h1>hello {props.namee}</h1>
}


CHILDREN PROPS
< Greet namee='jose' hero='captain America'>this is children prop</Greet>
< Greet namee='jane' hero='superman'><button>press</button></Greet>
< Greet namee='john' hero='batman'/>
this is children prop STATEMENT is a children prop and it only appears after jose
you can add any tags there example as in second Greet where there is a button
if we want to include a child prop we must include {prop.children} in the function of the component
if the jsx is taking multiple lines use ()
example:
const Greet=(props)=>{

    return (
        <div>
    <h1>hello {props.namee} you are {props.hero}</h1>

    {props.children}
    </div>
    )
    
   }
 there must be only one wrapper tag in jsx i.e div in above 

 in functional components we had props a the parameter but in class components we use this keyword
 example:
  return <h1>Class component hello {this.props.namee} you are {this.props.hero}</h1>

  props are immutable

  STATE
 in the class make a constructor in it make a super method and what to appear assign it to this.state
 constructor(){
        super()
        this.state={
            message:'welcome'
        }
    }
then in the return of render call it in jsx
 render(){
        return (
        <h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
    )
    }
the message can be change with a click of a button
add a button in the returnof the render
add an onClick attribute to it and assign it the method to be executed

 changemsg(){
        this.setState({message:'Thank you for subscribing'})
    }

    render(){
        return (
            <div>
<h1>{this.state.message}</h1>
<button onClick={()=> this.changemsg()}>suscribe</button>
            </div>
        
    )
    }

  PROPS AND STATE both affect UI in broser
  props are passed to the component state is managed within the component
  props are parameters in the function state variables are def in function body
  props are immutable state can be changed
  in function props is the parameter and state we use useState Hook
  in class this.props is used and state this.state is used

we can autofill the class components by typing rcc in the code field
we can autofill the function components by typing rfc in the code field

  SUMMARY
  create a component
  decide if you want it to be functional or class
  import React from 'react' if functional
  import React , {Component} from 'react' if class
  define a function in functional and dont forget the return if multiple lines in return include return()
  define a class if class component   that extends Component also remember render(){return}


we can autofill the class components by typing rcc in the code field
we can autofill the function components by typing rfc in the code field
provided ES7 extension is downloaded
here export is at the function and class def so we can edit it and export end of the file using export default function name
